We will test all functions on 3 GaN, 3In, and 3 real InGaN supercells.
For the larger cells we will just have to test the input and output using frozen older 
hard coded version of the functions we are testing, which we know work. This way 
we can do whatever changes we want and be sure that they still give the correct
behaviour.
