/* This function 'Skip_To_Command' sets the file pointer to point at the part of the file
 * one line past where the specified command is found. I.e. at the first piece
 * of data associated with that command for commands like frac, or cell etc.
 * The parameter cmdline is to contain any parameters that may be specified on the line
 * on which the command appears. For example, this will give a string containing all the paramters
 * for each of the potentials. The parameters can then be extracted using sscanf
 */

// occurs in the file. And it returns in cmdline the line on which the command occurs, which may contain needed parameters.
